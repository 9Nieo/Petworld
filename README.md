## 🌟 Introduction

PetWorld is an **innovative gaming platform** designed to test a **groundbreaking economic model** in a fun and engaging way. Unlike traditional models that reduce token emissions over time, our system implements:

- 🚀 **Triple-deflationary mechanism**
- 🔥 **Reward-based reverse burning system**
- 🎮 **Gamified participation**

```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 💎 Innovative Economic Model
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Triple-Deflation** | Three-layer token reduction mechanism |
| **Reverse Burning** | Players earn by reducing supply |
| **Burn-to-Earn** | Strategic burning maximizes rewards |

### ⛓️ Decentralized Participation
🔒 All operations are executed through **audited smart contracts** ensuring:
- Transparency

### 🎮 Dual Participation Methods

### 1. NFT Pet System (Play-to-Earn)

🐾 **Core Mechanics**:

📈 **Reward Structure**:

| Level | Multiplier |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | 1x         |
| 2     | 2x         |
| 3     | 3x         |
| 4     | 4x         |
| 5     | 5x         |
